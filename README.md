# Reinforcement_Learning_Stock_Test
A reinforcement learning (RL) project that simulates automated stock trading. The agent learns by interacting with a stock market environment â€” deciding when to buy, sell, or hold based on historical price data. The goal is to maximize long-term portfolio returns rather than short-term profit.
